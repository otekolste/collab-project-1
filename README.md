# Crossplay Connect

## Description
Imagine this: you've just gotten the latest chart-topping video game at your friend's recommendation. However, when you boot up your PC and hop onto call with your friend, you come to a depressing realization: your friend is on console, and the game doesn't offer cross-platform multiplayer!
Crossplay Connect is an interactive tool designed to provide the most popular, trending recommendations based on the platforms you're playing on. Selecting 2 different platforms will generate a list of the highest-rated games that offer cross-platform on both selected platforms, and allow you to check out the details of the game, as well as a trailer.
